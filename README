=============================================
Welcome to Apache SIS <http://sis.apache.org>
=============================================

Apache SIS(TM) is a spatial framework that enables better representation
of coordinates for searching, data clustering, archiving, or any other
relevant spatial needs.

SIS is a project of the Apache Software Foundation <http://www.apache.org/>.

Apache SIS, SIS, Apache, the Apache feather logo, and the Apache SIS
project logo are trademarks of The Apache Software Foundation.

Getting Started
===============

SIS is based on Java 6 and uses the Maven 2 <http://maven.apache.org/>
build system. To build SIS, use the following command in this directory:

    mvn clean install


Tomcat Server (See much simpler Jetty integration below)
========================================================
The build consists of a number of components, including a web-based application
file (WAR) you can use to try out SISfeatures. You can run it on top of Apache Tomcat like this:

    /usr/local/tomcat/bin/shutdown.sh
    mkdir /usr/local/sis
    cd /usr/local/sis
    cp -R /path/to/apache-sis-X.Y-src/sis-webapp/target/sis-webapp-X.Y.war ./
    cp -R /path/to/apache-sis-X.Y-src/sis-webapp/src/main/webapp/META-INF/context.xml ./sis.xml
    edit sis.xml (set the docBase to /usr/local/sis/sis-webapp-X.Y.war and the property
          org.apache.sis.services.config.filePath to /usr/local/sis/sis-location-config.xml,
          org.apache.sis.services.config.qIndexPath to /usr/local/sis/qtree,
          org.apache.sis.services.config.geodataPath to /usr/local/sis/geodata)
    cp -R /path/to/apache-sis-X.Y-src/sis-webapp/src/main/resources/sis-location-config.xml ./
    edit sis-location-config.xml (add or delete GeoRSS URLs)
    ln -s /usr/local/sis/sis.xml /usr/local/tomcat/conf/Catalina/localhost/sis.xml
    /usr/local/tomcat/bin/startup.sh
    Visit http://localhost:8080/sis/demo.jsp and checkout the demo!
    Try some queries:

    Bounding Box:
      0, 50, 50, 100

    Point Raidus:
      0, 80, 400km

Jetty Server
============
Jetty is now supported too (as of 02/11/2012). Simply build the project at the root level

	mvn clean install

Then browse to the sis-webapp directory. To run the built-in Jetty server, type the command:

	mvn jetty:run

Visit http://localhost:8080/sis-webapp/demp.jsp and run the same queries as noted above.

    Bounding Box:
      0, 50, 50, 100

    Point Raidus:
      0, 80, 400km
