/**
 * Adds the missing methods in {@code ChannelDataInput} for implementing the {@code ImageInputStream} interface.
 * This class is provided for testing the compatibility of {@code ChannelDataInput} API with {@code ImageInputStream},
 * and as a placeholder in case we want to move this implementation in the main code in a future SIS version.
 *
 * <p>Note that the JDK approach for creating an image input stream from a channel would be as below:</p>
 *
 * {@preformat java
 *     ReadableByteChannel channel = ...;
 *     ImageInputStream stream = ImageIO.createImageInputStream(Channels.newInputStream(channel));
 * }
 *
 * However the standard {@link javax.imageio.stream.ImageInputStreamImpl} implementation performs many work by itself,
 * including supporting various {@linkplain ByteOrder byte order}, which could be more efficiently done by NIO.
 *
 * <p>This class is provided as a <em>proof of concept</em> only - it is not intended to be used in the main SIS code.
 * This class lives in the {@code test} directory for that reason, where the "test" is to ensure that the API of the
 * {@link ChannelDataInput} base class is compatible with the {@link ImageInputStream} API.</p>
 *
 * <p>Note in particular that the {@link #readBit()} and {@link #readBits(int)} methods are not strictly compliant
 * to the {@code ImageInputStream}Â contract.</p>
