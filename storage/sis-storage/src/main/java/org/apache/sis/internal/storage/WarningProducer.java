/**
 * Base class of storage classes which may produce warnings. Warnings are emitted by invoking one of the
 * {@code warning(â€¦)} methods and encapsulated in {@link LogRecord} instances. All warnings ultimately
 * go through the {@link #sendWarning(LogRecord)} method, thus providing a single method to override if
 * some additional handling is needed. When a warning is emitted, there is a choice:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>If this {@code WarningProducer} is part of a larger process represented by an other {@code WarningProducer}
 *       instance (i.e. if this instance has a non-null {@link #sink}), then the {@link #sendWarning(LogRecord)}
 *       method will delegate its work to that other {@code WarningProducer} instance (the sink).</li>
 *
 *   <li>Otherwise, if there is any {@link WarningListener}, then those listeners are notified and the warning is
 *       <strong>not</strong> logged. This case is actually implemented by the {@link WarningConsumer} subclass.</li>
 *
 *   <li>Otherwise the warning is logged to the logger given to the {@link WarningConsumer} constructor.</li>
 * </ul>
