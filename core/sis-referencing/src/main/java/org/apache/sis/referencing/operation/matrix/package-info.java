/**
 * {@linkplain org.opengis.referencing.operation.Matrix} implementations tuned for spatio-temporal referencing.
 * Matrices can be of arbitrary size, but the most common ones in the context of spatio-temporal referencing are
 * not greater than 5Ã—5 (because the matrix size in affine transforms is the number of dimensions + 1).
 * This package differs from other matrix packages by the special treatment done for such small matrices.
 *
 * <p><b>Example:</b> In the two dimensional case, an affine transform from a map projection (units in metres)
 * to the screen (units in pixels) can be performed by the following matrix multiplication:</p>

 *
 * {@section Related projects}
 * This package is <strong>not</strong> designed for large matrices, and is rooted in
 * {@code org.apache.sis.referencing} for making clearer that this is not a general-purpose library.
 * For computational intensive calculations, better guarantees on numerical stability, sparse matrices support
 * and more, consider using an dedicated library like <a href="http://mikiobraun.github.io/jblas">jblas</a> instead.
 *
 * <p>The <a href="http://java.net/projects/vecmath">Vecmath</a> library shares similar goals than {@code MatrixSIS}.
 * Like SIS, Vecmath is optimized for small matrices of interest for 2D and 3D graphics.</p>
